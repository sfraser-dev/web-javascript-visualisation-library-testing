# Visualisation Testing

This project explores various JavaScript libraries to display dummy data using tables, Gantt charts, line charts, and bar charts. The libraries tested include:

- amCharts
- visTimeline
- Frappe Gantt
- D3.js
- Chart.js
- Google Charts
- Highcharts
- ApexCharts.js
- billboard.js

It also demonstrates the integration of Bootstrap-Metronic UI Kit with some of these charting libraries.

## Important: Running the Project

**This project requires a local web server to function correctly**, for example VS Code with Live Server (recommended).

## Usage

Once the local server is running, open the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:port`) in your browser to access the `index.html` page. This page provides a list of links to the various visualizations using different libraries.

## Data

The dummy data used for the visualizations is located in the following JSON files:

- `fleetData.json` (EV data)
- `fleetDataStayDiesel.json` (Diesel data)
